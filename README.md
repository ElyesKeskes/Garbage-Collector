## 🎮 About the Game  

**Garbage Collector** is a unique simulation game where the focus is on **visualizing AI pathfinding algorithms** like **A\***, **Ad-Hoc** routing, and **Monte Carlo methods**. NPCs act as garbage collectors, navigating the environment to collect trash while avoiding dynamic obstacles—**the dogs**!  

This game serves as both an educational and entertaining showcase of advanced AI behaviors in a Unity environment.

## 🌟 Key Features  

- ♻️ **Garbage Collection**: NPCs autonomously navigate the environment to locate and collect garbage.  
- 🐕 **Avoid "The Dogs"**: NPCs must dodge dynamic, randomized threats to avoid losing progress.  
- 🧠 **Algorithm Visualization**:  
  - **A\***: Demonstrates optimal pathfinding in a static grid.  
  - **Ad-Hoc**: Showcases adaptive routing for dynamically changing environments.  
  - **Monte Carlo**: Highlights decision-making under uncertainty.  
- 🌍 **Dynamic Environment**: Randomized garbage and obstacle placement ensure varied scenarios every run.  
- 🎨 **Stylized Graphics**: A minimalistic and colorful visual style keeps the focus on AI behaviors.

## 🧩 Gameplay Overview  

### 🕹️ Core Mechanics  
1. **NPC Objectives**:  
   - Locate and collect garbage scattered across the map.  
   - Avoid dynamically moving dogs that patrol the area.  

2. **Algorithm Focus**:  
   - Each NPC uses a different AI behavior to navigate the map.  
   - Players can toggle between algorithms to observe differences in decision-making.  

3. **Win Condition**:  
   - Successfully collect all garbage without getting caught by the dogs.

## 🔍 Algorithms in Action  

- **A\***:  
  - NPCs calculate the shortest path to each garbage location, avoiding static obstacles.  
  - Demonstrates classic grid-based pathfinding.  

- **Ad-Hoc Routing**:  
  - NPCs adapt their routes dynamically as new obstacles (e.g., dogs) appear.  
  - Highlights reactive decision-making in real-time.  

- **Monte Carlo Method**:  
  - NPCs evaluate probabilities of success to decide on the best course of action.  
  - Showcases decision-making under uncertainty.
